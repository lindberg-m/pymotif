Prerequisites
=============

You need Python (tested with 2.4, but I see no reason why 2.3 wouldn't work)
with the BioPython library (tested with 1.30) installed.

If you use Debian, run 'apt-get install python-biopython' to install the
BioPython library.

If you use Ubuntu, run the same after adding the 'universe' repository to your
sources.list file.

BioPython can be found at: http://www.biopython.org/


Running PyMotif
===============


Run PyMotif with the -h option for a complete overview of all command line
options accepted by PyMotif.
