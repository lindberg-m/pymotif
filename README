PyMotif version 0.1, 2005/10/23

PyMotif is an implementation of the Gibbs sampling algorithm for finding
local alignments of DNA sequences.


Prerequisites
=============

You need Python (tested with 2.4, but I see no reason why 2.3 wouldn't work)
with the BioPython library (tested with 1.30) installed.

If you use Debian, run 'apt-get install python-biopython' to install the
BioPython library.

If you use Ubuntu, run the same after adding the 'universe' repository to your
sources.list file and having done a 'apt-get update'.

BioPython can be found at: http://www.biopython.org/


Running PyMotif
===============

PyMotif take two required command line arguments:

    -i FILE     input file in Fasta format
    -w WIDTH    width of the motif to find

Example usage:

    martijn@priscilla:~/a4g/motifs/pymotif$ ./pymotif.py -i GAL.seq -w 5
    Motif occurrences in sequences follow
    Sequence # 1  AGATA  (at position 412)
    Sequence # 2  ACATA  (at position 89)
    Sequence # 3  ACATA  (at position 334)
    Sequence # 4  AGATA  (at position 393)
    Sequence # 5  ACATA  (at position 358)
    Sequence # 6  ACATA  (at position 209)
    Sequence # 7  ACATA  (at position 14)
    Sequence # 8  ACATA  (at position 60)
    martijn@priscilla:~/a4g/motifs/pymotif$

PyMotif takes a number of optional command line arguments, run PyMotif with
the -h option for a complete overview.

By default, no phase shifts are detected by the algorithm. Add (e.g.) -s 2 for
detecting phase shifts up to two nucleotides width.

Also by default, the initial motif positions heuristic is not employed. Add
(e.g.) -n 2 -v 6 to use 2 base occurrences in patterns of width 6 for the
initial motif positions heuristic (see below for more information).


Implementation details
======================

A report with more implementation details and a short comparison with the
AlignACE program can be found in the documentation directory.
